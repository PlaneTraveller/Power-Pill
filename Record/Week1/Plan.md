Authors: *dh, lzh, why*


## 1. Preparations:
* Deadline: May. 26

### Tasks:
In the first half of this week, we are going to learn several tools by completing following tasks. In our next meeting, we will exchange whatever knowledge we've gained.

> The goal of these tasks is to familiarize us with fundamental tools a programmer would use in his workflow such as `github`, `shell`, `crawler`, `markdown`.

#### Markdown
- Understand the logic of markdown texts
- Understand the basic syntax of markdown
- Install a markdown editor (Typora)

> <u>**Upload**:</u> A structured markdown file of markdown syntax notes (use tables, showcase your knowledge of titles, **bold**, *italic*, <u>underlines</u>)
 


#### Github
- Understand the basic concept and logic of `github` (go through official manual)
- Register for a github account
- Create your first repository

> <u>**Upload**:</u> Add your account information to the previous markdown file so that we can follow each other.



#### Crawler
- Go through PPT
- Study basic concepts of crawling
- Prepare a python environment for crawling
- *If you have time, crawl for information on any website for exercise.*

> <u>**Upload**:</u> Add your study notes or code to previous markdown files
 
 

#### Shell
- Understand the basic concepts of `shell` language
	* Different types of `shell`
	* Fundamental syntax of `shell`
	* Use cases of `shell`
	* Install a functional terminal emulator and install your shell of choice (try fish or zsh)
	 

> <u>**Upload**:</u> Add the shell commands that you've learned to the previous markdown file, and share with us the differences of shells(zsh, bash, csh, fish, etc..)



## Task 1: Crawl the data
- Coding:
	* Finding URLs (Automate later)
	* Obtain Json data (with `requests`)
	* Json data transcription (with `json`)
	* Data organization and output (with `pandas`, `numpy`)



- Structures
	* readme structure
	* repo structure



- Determining data to obtain (considering task 3)
